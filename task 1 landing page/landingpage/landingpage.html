               <h3 style="color:black;">Performance</h3>
               <p style="color:black;">Team India’s Test and ODI captain Virat Kohli’s drought of centuries continues. Kohli has not been able to score any century in the last two years. Virat, who is called run machine, is not able to play big innings. 2020 was the first year in the life of Virat, who started his career in 2008, when he did not score a century with the bat. Now 2021 is also almost on the verge of ending and Virat has not been able to score any century in this year also. If Kohli does not score a century in the first match of the Africa tour, then this year also his bat will not get any century. With this, it will be the second consecutive year that he will not be able to score a century.</p>
